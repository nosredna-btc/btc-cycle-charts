## Overview
Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Charts is a web-based application designed to visualize Bitcoin's historical and projected price cycles using various analytical models. The project consists of a Python backend that processes Bitcoin data to generate insightful charts and a frontend built with a single HTML file that presents these charts in an interactive and user-friendly manner.

## Features
- Dynamic Chart Generation: Automatically generates charts based on Bitcoin's 4-year cycles using different analytical models.
- Interactive Frontend: A single HTML file that displays charts with options to navigate between different models.
- BTC Updates: Fetches the latest Bitcoin data periodically to ensure charts are up-to-date (within the last few hours).
- Keyboard left and right to advance through the current group of charts when magnified.
